## Introduction
Telepresence is a young and promising space that has the potential for bringing people together in newer and more 
flexible ways.  2020 has been a year of deeper isolation for many people, and the long hours of video conferencing 
have made it possible to maintain more of life and work than would have been possible otherwise.  If instead of just
appearing passively on a screen, the remote people could engage more actively in the meeting space and with the other 
participants, the quality of communicating and connecting with each other would be radically enhanced and begin to 
feel more natural.  In addition, being more deeply and continuously connected with family and community might also help 
people maintain their independence during periods of their lives that would have traditionally required specialized 
facilities.  Imagine a robot that is not only a telepresence device but is also equipped with sophisticated sensors and 
other devices to help people monitor their health issues and enable proactive support services.  Since a telepresence 
robot could have many remote users, doctors could make virutal house calls and provide a level of service beyond 
even the telehealth capabilities that have advanced over the past year.  The decision to open source the project now
is in the hope that it might be of some use or inspiration to others who seek to bring people closer together in the
years ahead.

This project houses an experimental code base for exploring robotics software architectures.  The concept of 
"robot" in the architecture is a distributed set of services and capabilities focused on satisfying one or more use
cases and typically delivered by one or more robotic hardware devices.  Telepresence, especially for residential use
cases, has been an initial target in mind to help guide the research.

The project started in 2009 and has been progressing as a non-commercial, private research endeavor on a very part time 
basis over the past 11 years.  During that period, the capabilities of cloud platforms, further development and adoption
robotic operating systems like ROS, the rise of digital assistants like Alexa and Siri, and other advances in the state 
of the art have demonstrated that distributed and extensible sets of services can be integrated to produce a wide range 
of useful capabilities.  Adding physical robots as part of delivering those capabilities is a logical next step.  The
primary goals of learning and developing concepts have been progressing alongside developments in the broader industry,
and it's fun to participate and to play along.

To support development and testing of the software and architecture, a single robotics development hardware platform was
constructed.  While the code base here is configured for the specifics of that particular robot, the architecture and 
capabilities of the software would support a wide range of alternative hardware.  The software could be used as a whole
system, or its packages and modules could be used individually as needed to help with other projects.  As the code is
currently in an experimental state, it has not yet been packaged into a standard distribution package.  Instead, users
can clone or download this repository or any of its components, subject to the included Apache 2 license agreement and
notices.
